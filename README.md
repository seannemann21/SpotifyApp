# THIS APP IS OLD, Check out we-dj app for updated version

This app allows users to vote on tracks to create a playlist. The host user creates a room that other users can then join by entering the three letter code associated with it. The Spotify Web API and Spotify Web Playback SDK are used, so the host user must have Spotify Premium and be running the desktop version of Chrome, Firefox, IE, or Edge. Most of the testing was performed on Chrome, so it is recommended for best performance. Once users are in the room, the host can create playlists on which they can collaborate. Uses may add songs to the onboarding list which others (and themselves) may rate. Once a song is needed for the playlist, the song with the highest average rating is moved to the playlist from the onboarding list. The number of songs that a user picks that end up being voted onto the playlist are tracked, and after a certain amount of their songs are chosen, they receive a free selection that will be added to the playlist regardless of the votes it receives. When a user has a free pick ready, a star is shown next to the search box. Songs that are added to the playlist due to a free pick are not counted among the user's total selected songs. The user's total selected songs are listed next to the user's name in the user table on the left.
